## 📌 About the Project

This project is a Python-based football simulation that demonstrates the concept of **intelligent agents** in Artificial Intelligence. Each football player is modeled as an autonomous agent that can perceive its environment and take actions based on predefined rules.

---

## 🧠 Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
- Understand the working of AI agents
- Implement the PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) model
- Simulate decision-making behavior in a football environment

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The environment maintains the position of the ball and players.
- Each agent perceives the current state of the environment.
- Based on ball possession and distance calculations, the agent decides an action.
- Actions include shooting, passing, tackling, intercepting, or moving to open space.

---

## 🎮 Agent Actions

The football agents can perform the following actions:
- Shoot towards the goal
- Pass the ball to a teammate
- Dribble towards the opponent goal
- Tackle an opponent
- Intercept the ball
- Move to gain possession

---

## 🧪 Simulation

The program runs different scenarios to demonstrate agent behavior such as:
- Scoring attempts near the goal
- Defensive tackling
- Gaining possession of a loose ball
- Supporting teammates during attack

## 💻 Execution

To run the project:
```bash
python football_simulation.py
